With iPat, GWAS or GS can be performed using a pointing device to simply drag and/or click on graphical elements to specify input data files, choose input parameters, and select analytical models. It can also serve as a format converter for people who want to use the converted files for other purposes. "],

["workflow.html", "2.1 Workflow", " 2.1 Workflow To perform GWAS, GS, and GWAS-assisted GS in iPat, following six steps are demonstrated for users to follow: Create a new module Every single analysis is defined by a ‘module’, which can be created by double-click anywhere in the screen and opened by right-click on a gear-shaped icon which is newly created. It’s noted that there will always be an automatically created module at the very beginning when users launch iPat, so users only need to right-click on the gear-shaped icon to start their first analysis. Fig. Right click to open a module Import files Users can drag-and-drop their files to import them into iPat. Each filetype has its own slot, and each analysis have slightly different requirements for the imported files. Please follow the instruction in section 2.3, 2.4, 2.5 to learn for further information. Fig. Drag-and-drop files to import Choose an analysis Currently there’re four analyses available in iPat. Once users done importing all the required files, they can click a desired analysis to enter the next panel for further configuration. Fig. Choose an analysis for further configuration Config and run Usually there’re two parts in this panel. In the upper part, users can specify the working directory, which phenotype to be analyzed, and quality controls on genetic markers. This panel can be globally defined regardless chosen analysis (section -2.2). Whereas the sub-panel in the bottom part is tool-specific, this area allows users to define the chosen tool in details. Please read section 2.3, 2.4, 2.5 for further information. The analysis will be launched when ‘run’ button in the right-corner is clicked. Fig. Detailed configuration for the analysis Monitor progress Users can hover the pointer on the running module to monitor its progress, or to click on the module to lock the progress window, which can prevent it from disappearing when the pointer is no longer hovered on the module. Fig. Hover the pointer to monitor the progress Inspect results Once the analysis is done, a green dot will present at the upper-left corner of the module. Users can open the working directory and find all the output files by double-clicking on the module. Fig. Double click to open the working directory "],

Fig. Panel for users to define working directory 2.2.2 Phenotype Sometimes users may have several traits in one phenotype file, but not all of them are traits of interest. To deal with this concern, in this panel, traits can be selected and excluded for the following analysis. Click ‘–&gt;’ button to exclude traits that are not the interest of this analysis, or click ‘&lt;–’ button to rescue back traits that are mistakenly excluded. Fig. Panel for users to select traits of interest 2.2.3 Quality Control Two ways of quality controls (QC) are available in this panel, both ways will be applied to genetic markers. ‘By missing rate’ will filter out any marker that has missing rate (i.e., 1 - calling rate) higher than the assigned value. ‘By MAF’ will filter out markers with minor allele frequency lower than the assigned value.

["gs.html", "2.4 GS", " 2.4 GS It’s required to provide genotype and phenotype files to run GS in iPat. User-provided covariates will serve as fixed effects in the GS model, but none of GS methods will take user-defined kinship in iPat. In iPat, users can perform two types of GS. If the ‘validation’ option is unchecked, iPat would estimate genetic estimated breeding values (GEBV) for samples in the whole dataset based on the phenotyped samples. Whereas when users check the option ‘Validation on accuracy’, iPat will split whole dataset into training and testing samples in order to verify the capability of trained GS model. For this manner, validation accuracies will be reported instead of GEBVs. TABLE 2.4: Arguments for GS Arguments Default Options Description Validation on accuracy unchecked checked, unchecked If k-fold validation is performed in GS Folds 3 3, 5, 10 K value for K-fold validation. For example, if k = 5, 20% samples will be tested as accuracy validation. Iteration 10 Range from 10 to 100 Number of iterations.

The workflow for GWAS-assisted GS in iPat is basically the same as performing GWAS and GS alone, please follow the tutorial for details. "],
["format-converter.html", "2.6 Format converter", " 2.6 Format converter iPat not only provides a format-free environment for genomic studies, it also allows users to utilize the build-in converter to convert files for other further purposes. By providing a genotype file and a map file (if applicable) that meet a certain format, iPat can convert them into numerical-encoded genotypes or PLINK format that is compatible to other software. Other than specifying requested formats and arguments for quality controls, users can decide whether they would like to have missing values filled as heterozygous genotypes. Also, the argument “Batch size” determines how many samples are read into the memory at a time. The larger the batch size is, the faster the conversion would be. However, for those computing units with limited memory resources, it’s highly recommended to start from a smaller number such as 64 or 32. Large batch size will crash the program easily when dealing with a large number of markers.
