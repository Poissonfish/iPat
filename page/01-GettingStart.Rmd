# Get started

The operation environment need to meet the following requirements:

- [Java Runtime Environment (JRE)](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html): **Version 8** or later.

- [R](https://www.r-project.org): Version **3.5** or later.
  (It's highly recommended to update R to the latest version for first-time users, since some packages may not be available to download in older versions of R)

Install all the required R libraries by running following code. This command will download all the missing packages that are required in iPat.

```r
source("http://zzlab.net/iPat/iPat_installation.r")
```

## Windows users
1. Download [iPat.zip](http://zzlab.net/iPat/iPat.zip) and decompress it. You will then get a folder named "**iPat**", which contains a executable file "**iPat.exe**" and a folder "**res**".

2. It's noted that users are always required to place "**iPat.exe**" and the folder "**res**" in the same folder (directory) so that iPat can function normally.

3. Double click '**iPat.exe**' to launch iPat.
